# YALisp (Yet Another Lisp)

A simple single header (all source code is in `yalisp.h`) implementation of subset Lisp written in C.

```
Welcome to Yet Another Lisp (YALisp)!
Type in lisp expressions, and I'll execute them :3
(yalisp) > 42
42
(yalisp) > (+ 3 (- 2 1))
4
(yalisp) > (concat "hello" " " "world")
"hello world"
```
